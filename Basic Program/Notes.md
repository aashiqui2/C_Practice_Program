Yes, that's correct! When the condition `i * i <= n` is used in the loop, it effectively checks all potential factors up to the square root of \( n \) (in this case, \( \sqrt{45} \)).

Let’s go through this step by step:

### 1. **Understanding the Condition**:
- The loop runs while \( i \times i \leq n \). This means the loop continues as long as \( i^2 \) is less than or equal to \( n \).
- Since \( i^2 \) is just \( i \times i \), this checks if \( i \) is smaller than or equal to the square root of \( n \).

### 2. **Why Only Check Up to \( \sqrt{n} \)?**:
When you are finding factors, any factor pair \( (a, b) \) of a number \( n \) must satisfy \( a \times b = n \). If \( a \) is smaller than \( \sqrt{n} \), then \( b \) must be larger than \( \sqrt{n} \), and vice versa. By the time you've checked all numbers up to \( \sqrt{n} \), you've accounted for all possible factor pairs.

### Example: \( n = 45 \)

- \( \sqrt{45} \approx 6.7 \). So, the square root of 45 is about 6.7.
- In the loop, we will check values of \( i \) where \( i \times i \leq 45 \). This translates to \( i \leq 6.7 \), so we only need to check up to \( i = 6 \).

The actual values of \( i \) we check:
- **i = 3**: Since \( 3 \times 3 = 9 \leq 45 \), we check if 3 is a factor.
- **i = 5**: Since \( 5 \times 5 = 25 \leq 45 \), we check if 5 is a factor.

After this, any potential factor of 45 larger than \( \sqrt{45} \) would have already been found through the corresponding smaller factors (i.e., 5 is paired with 9, and 3 is paired with 15).

### 3. **Efficiency**:
By checking up to \( \sqrt{45} \), we avoid unnecessary checks of larger numbers that cannot be prime factors. If we were to check all the way up to 45, it would be inefficient because once you’ve found all factors up to the square root, the remaining factor pairs are automatically covered.

### Summary:

- **Yes**, when we say \( i \times i \leq n \), it is essentially checking if \( i \leq \sqrt{n} \).
- For \( n = 45 \), this means checking up to \( \sqrt{45} \approx 6.7 \), so the loop will check values \( i = 3 \) and \( i = 5 \), which are both prime factors of 45.


//! Point To notice
/*
Pair Factors: For any factor pair (𝑎,𝑏) of a number  n,
one of the factors 
𝑎 will be less than or equal to the square root of 𝑛 and the other factor 𝑏 will be greater than or equal to the square root
of 𝑛

For example, consider 60:

The factor pairs are (1, 60), (2, 30), (3, 20), (4, 15), (5, 12), and (6, 10).
Notice that in each pair, one factor is less than or equal to the square root of 60 (approximately 7.74), and the other factor is greater than or equal to this value.

Yes, exactly! A **prime number** is defined as a number greater than 1 that has no divisors other than 1 and itself. In other words, a prime number cannot be **factorized** (broken down into smaller numbers) other than as `1 * itself`.

### Prime Number Definition:
- A prime number is a number greater than 1 that **cannot** be expressed as a product of two smaller natural numbers.
- Examples of prime numbers: `2`, `3`, `5`, `7`, `11`, `13`, `17`, `19`, etc.

### Composite Number Definition:
- A **composite number** is a number greater than 1 that **can** be factorized into smaller integers (other than 1 and itself).
- Examples of composite numbers: `4`, `6`, `8`, `9`, `12`, `15`, etc.
  
#### Examples:
1. **Prime number**:
   - Take `7`. The only factors of `7` are `1` and `7`, so it **cannot** be factored into smaller numbers.
  
2. **Composite number**:
   - Take `12`. It **can** be factored as `2 * 6`, or `3 * 4`, meaning it's divisible by numbers other than `1` and `12`. Hence, `12` is **not prime**.

Thus, **if a number can be factorized**, it means it has divisors other than 1 and itself, and it is **not a prime number**; it's a composite number.
